# Medical-data-Visulaization

This project is creating a visualiztion story in tableau on Mental Health Survey in Tech Industry. 

The Dataset used in this project is downladed from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey 
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. You are also encouraged to analyze data from the ongoing 2016 survey found here.

There are 1259 rows and 27 columns in the dataset.

Before using the dataset the dataset was pre-processed using Python languge which has helped me in gaining a general overview about the dataset such as:
  1. Timestamp was irrelavant for further analysis.
  2. Age is the only feature that has float data type.
  3. All features except for Timestamp and Age have nominal categorical data type.
  4. There is no data validation in the Comments feature.
